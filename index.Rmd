## Purpose

The codebook presented here contains variables for the 1930 census.

The descriptions are taken from three sources.

- The 1900 and 1910 census, where the source is listed as "Swepop codebook"
- The documentation that came with the 1930 census, translated to english and listed as "1930 census"
- Descriptions I wrote to explain the derived variables, listed as "Generated"

You can use the search box in the table to get to the variable quickly.
